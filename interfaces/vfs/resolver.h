 *  resolve object location to either an existing local path,

 *  "protocols" [ IN ] - the desired protocols for remote resolution
 *
 *  "query" [ IN ] - a path that can represent:
 *     accession : a recognizable accession from NCBI or known organization
 *     obj-id    : a dbGaP object id
 *     name      : a dbGaP filename
 *     path      : a filesystem path
 *     url       : a remote location
 *
 *  "local" [ OUT, NULL OKAY ] - optional return parameter for local path:
 *     accession : resolve to local user or site path
 *     obj-id    : resolve to local user protected path
 *     name      : resolve to local user protected path
 *     url       : set to NULL
 *
 *  "remote" [ OUT, NULL OKAY ] - optional return parameter for remote path:
 *     accession : resolve to URL
 *     obj-id    : resolve to URL
 *     name      : resolve to URL
 *     url       : set to duplicate

 *     obj-id    : resolve to user cache path
 *     path      : set to NULL
 *     url       : resolve to user cache path
 *
 *  any of the output parameters may be NULL, but not all, i.e. there
 *  must be at least one non-NULL return parameter.
 *
 *  if you DON'T want local resolution, pass NULL for "local" and
 *  the query will be resolved remotely. if you don't want remote
 *  resolution, pass NULL for "remote".
 *
 *  a query that is resolved locally will always return NULL for
 *  "remote" and "cache", if the parameters are provided.

 *  Or should it be a directory or a file url depending upon finding a partial
 *  download? This would require co-ordination with all download mechanisms that
 *  we permit.
 *
 *  With refseq holding wgs objects we have a case were the downloaded file is not
 *  named the same as the original accession as the file archive you want is a
 *  container for other files.
 *
 *  Find local will give a path that has a special scheme in these cases. 
 *  Find remote will give the url for the container that contains the accession
 *  so using the returned VPath from resolve remote is better than the original
 *  accession in this one case.  I think...
